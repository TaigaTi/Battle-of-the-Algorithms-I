# This is the Player 1 AI controller file.
# Contestants should implement their snake AI logic within this file.
# Your code will determine Player 1's next move based on the provided game state.
#
# You will need to implement two functions:
# 1. `get_next_move(board_state_data, player_state_data, opponent_state_data)`:
#    This function should return the next direction for the snake ("up", "down", "left", or "right").
# 2. `set_player_name()`:
#    This function should return a string representing the name of your AI player.
#
# For more detailed information on the expected input and output formats,
# please refer to the documentation at `docs/controller_api.md`.
# Happy Coding!
