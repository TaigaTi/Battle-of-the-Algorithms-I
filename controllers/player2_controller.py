# This is the Player 2 AI controller file.
# You can implement your snake AI logic here to test playing against an opponent.
# This is useful for developing and debugging your Player 1 AI.
#
# Similar to Player 1, you will need to implement:
# 1. `get_next_move(board_state_data, player_state_data, opponent_state_data)`
# 2. `set_player_name()`
#
# Refer to `docs/controller_api.md` for more details.
# Good Luck!
