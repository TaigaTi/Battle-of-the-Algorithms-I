# Battle of the Algorithms 🏆🐍

A week-long AI coding tournament where developers compete by programming intelligent snakes for survival in a strategic grid-based game. Participants submit Python-based AI algorithms that navigate, collect food, and avoid obstacles while competing against rival snakes. The competition follows an elimination-style format, leading to a final showdown to determine the ultimate champion!  

## Key Features  

- ⚔️ **Elimination Tournament** – Compete head-to-head until only one remains  
- 🧠 **AI-Driven Snake Game** – Program your snake using decision-making & pathfinding  
- 🎯 **Survival & Strategy** – Avoid obstacles, collect food, and outlast opponents  
- 🔗 **Standardized API** – Integrate your AI seamlessly into the game environment
